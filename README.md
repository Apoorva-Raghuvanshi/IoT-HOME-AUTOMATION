# IoT-HOME-AUTOMATION
I developed this project by using Arduino IDE (for coding purpose) and Proteus 8 Professional (for simulation purpose).
# INTRODUCTION:
Home automation gives you access to control devices in your home from a laptop, mobile device anywhere in the world
A home automation system will monitor or control home attributes such as lighting, climate, entertainment systems and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems

# COMPONENTS USED:
One Arduino Uno
Two diodes
Two resistance of 1K ohm 
Two transistors 
One lamp
One fan
Two relay
One alternator
One virtual terminal

# WORKING (SIMULATION BY USING PROTEUS 8 PROFESSIONAL):

On pressing 1 on the virtual terminal , the light will turn ON
On pressing 2 on the virtual terminal , the light will turn OFF
On pressing 3 on the virtual terminal , the fan will turn ON
On pressing 4 on the virtual terminal , the fan will turn OFF
On pressing 5 on the virtual terminal , both light and fan will turn ON
On pressing 6 on the virtual terminal , both light and fan will turn OFF
