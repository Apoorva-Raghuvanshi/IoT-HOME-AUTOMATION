# IoT-HOME-AUTOMATION
I developed this project by using Arduino IDE (for coding purpose) and Proteus 8 Professional (for simulation purpose).
# INTRODUCTION:
Home automation gives you access to control devices in your home from a laptop, mobile device anywhere in the world
A home automation system will monitor or control home attributes such as lighting, climate, entertainment systems and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems

# COMPONENTS USED:
1. One Arduino Uno
2. Two diodes
3. Two resistance of 1K ohm 
4. Two transistors 
5. One lamp
6. One fan
7. Two relay
8. One alternator
9. One virtual terminal

# WORKING (SIMULATION BY USING PROTEUS 8 PROFESSIONAL):

1. On pressing 1 on the virtual terminal , the light will turn ON
2. On pressing 2 on the virtual terminal , the light will turn OFF
3. On pressing 3 on the virtual terminal , the fan will turn ON
4. On pressing 4 on the virtual terminal , the fan will turn OFF
5. On pressing 5 on the virtual terminal , both light and fan will turn ON
6. On pressing 6 on the virtual terminal , both light and fan will turn OFF
